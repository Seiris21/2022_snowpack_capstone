abstract = {Substantial progress on machine learning (ML) models and graphical processing units (GPUs) has stimulated emerging research in applications of ML to earth science. As snow is a vital component of the global hydroclimate system, precise snowpack prediction is of considerable value for science and society. In this work, we have trained three different ML models (LSTM, CNN and Attention) to predict daily snow water equivalent (SWE) with both dynamic and static features in the Western Contiguous United States from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) observations. Dynamic features include precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, minimum and maximum relative humidity, specific humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity. Static features are latitude, longitude, elevation, diurnal anisotropic heating (DAH) index and topographic radiative aspect (TRASP) index. This choice of features allows us to produce high-resolution maps of regional SWE for a given set of input meteorological conditions. The importance and the sensitivity of input variables will be tested by several explainable AI methods including feature permutation and integrated gradient. The ML-based dataset is further up-sampled and compared with the 4km gridded SWE dataset from the National Snow &amp;amp; Ice Data Center (NSIDC), which is from a physical-based model. Future SWE estimates are also produced under climate conditions projected by CMIP class models, along with associated uncertainty estimates based on our sensitivity analysis. The ML models are demonstrated to be a fast and accurate method of producing high-resolution SWE estimates with minimal computing power.}

abstract = {Abstract A detailed picture of how snowfall varies across high-elevation mountain ranges in both space and time remains a knowledge gap in understanding the montane hydrologic cycle. Previous studies generally used point-scale snow measurements in an attempt to represent the spatial variability of snowfall across a range; however, these traditional approaches provide incomplete insight into the cumulative snowfall (CS) distribution from the basin-scale to the mountain range-scale. In this study, a high-resolution, spatially distributed snow reanalysis was utilized to characterize 31 winters (water years 1985–2015) of snowfall distributions, snowfall accumulation rates, and snowstorms across the Sierra Nevada (USA). The CS data set (quantified in units of snow water equivalent) was verified against over 2600 station years of in situ observations. The seasonal CS was found to have mean and root-mean-squared differences of −4 and 12 cm, respectively, and a correlation of 0.96 with snow pillow observations. Using this novel CS information, results indicated that the CS accumulates rapidly across all 20 basins examined with, on average, at least 50\% of the integrated CS accumulating in less than or equal to 6 days or three snowstorms over each basin. The largest (or leading) snowstorms each season yield ∼27\% of the CS, on average, and most frequently last 4 days. Across the range, over 40\% of the leading snowstorms occur in February. This study showed that the hydroclimatology of the Sierra Nevada is driven by hydrological extremes as manifested in the high interannual variability of its seasonally integrated CS, 4.4–41.3 km3, during the 31 years.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely estimates of groundwater storage changes are critical to the sustainable management of aquifers worldwide, but are hindered by the lack of in-situ groundwater measurements in most regions. Hydrologic remote sensing measurements provide a potential pathway to quantify groundwater storage changes by closing the water balance, but the degree to which remote sensing data can accurately estimate groundwater storage changes is unclear. In this study, we quantified groundwater storage changes in California's Central Valley at two spatial scales for the period 2002 through 2020 using remote sensing data and an ensemble water balance method. To evaluate performance, we compared estimates of groundwater storage changes to three independent estimates: GRACE satellite data, groundwater wells and a groundwater flow model. Results suggest evapotranspiration has the highest uncertainty among water balance components, while precipitation has the lowest. We found that remote sensing-based groundwater storage estimates correlated well with independent estimates; annual trends during droughts fall within 15% of trends calculated using wells and groundwater models within the Central Valley. Remote sensing-based estimates also reliably estimated the long-term trend, seasonality, and rate of groundwater depletion during major drought events. Additionally, our study suggests that the proposed method estimate changes in groundwater at sub-annual latencies, which is not currently possible using other methods. The findings have implications for improving the understanding of aquifer dynamics and can inform regional water managers about the status of groundwater systems during droughts.}

abstract = {Abstract Groundwater depletion is a major threat to agricultural and municipal water supply in California's Central Valley. Recent droughts during 2007–2009 and 2012–2016 exacerbated chronic groundwater depletion. However, it is unclear how much groundwater storage recovered from drought-related overdrafts during post-drought years, and how climatic conditions and water management affected recovery times. We estimated groundwater storage change in the Central Valley for April 2002 through September 2019 using four methods: GRACE satellite data, a water balance approach, a hydrologic simulation model, and monitoring wells. We also evaluated the sensitivity of drought recovery to different climate scenarios (recent climate ± droughts and future climate change scenarios: 20 GCMs and 2 RCPs) using water balance method and statistical sampling of historical climate data. Estimated Central Valley groundwater loss during the two droughts ranged from 19 km3 (2007–2009) to 28 km3 (2012–2016) (median of four methods). Median aquifer storage recovery was 34\% and 19\% of the overdraft during the 2010–2011 and 2017–2019 post-drought years, respectively. Numerical experiments show that recovery times are sensitive to climate forcing, with longer recovery times for a future climate scenario that replicate historical climatology relative to historical forcing with no droughts. Overdraft recovery times decrease by ∼2× with implementation of pumping restrictions (30th to 50th percentiles of historical groundwater depletion) to constrain groundwater depletion relative to no restrictions with a no-drought future climatology. This study highlights the importance of considering water management implications for future drought recoveries within the context of climate change scenarios.},

abstract = {Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6% to 2.2% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81% variance with 1.4% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73% and -2.4%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75% and -15.9%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with -9.2% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86% and -11.3%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64% and 28.2%, respectively) and NWM (33% and -30.1%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.}

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the extent to which the diagnosed contribution of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to the seasonal cumulative snowfall (CS) is related to the AR detection approach utilized. Using both satellite integrated water vapor (IWV)-based and reanalysis integrated vapor transport (IVT)-based methodologies, the corresponding AR-derived CS distributions were characterized over the Sierra Nevada (USA) from 1998 to 2015. AR detection methods indicated that ARs yield greater orographic enhancement of the seasonal CS than non-AR storms above ~2,100–2,300 m for the IWV-based approach and over all elevations for the IVT-based detection approach across the western (i.e., windward) Sierra Nevada. Due to differences in the methodologies, the IWV-based approach diagnosed 2.1 times fewer ARs than the IVT-based approach. As a result, the ARs diagnosed using the IWV-based detection method yielded an average 33\% of the total range-wide CS annually as opposed to 56\% from the IVT-based detection method.},
